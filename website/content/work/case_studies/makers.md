The MAKERS project is a historic video initiative between PBS and AOL featuring exclusive access to trailblazing women such as Hillary Clinton, Katie Couric, Marissa Mayer, Sandra Day O'Conner, Condoleezza Rice, Sheryl Sandberg, Gloria Steinem, Martha Stwewart and Barbara Walters.

[MAKERS.com](http://www.MAKERS.com) uses an adaptive and fluid layout to assure that the site looks good on any device and at any screen resolution. Built to take advantage in the latest that web browsers have to offer, text, images and design elements are dynamically scaled on the fly for optimum readability.

Gin Lane oversaw design, creative direction and project management. The backend development was provided by Ashe Avenue in tandem with Mathematic and Gin Lane.

Mathematic was hired by [Gin Lane Media](http://www.ginlanemedia.com) for front-end development including the implementation of a responsive layout. Gin Lane oversaw design, creative direction and project management. Back-end development was provided by [Ashe Avenue](http://www.asheavenue.com) in tandem with Gin Lane.

Tooling used:

* Rapid prototyping using Flask and Heroku
* Sass for modularization of stylesheets and to ease cross-browser development.
* Javascript modularization/namespacing using AMD/require.js
* Testing using [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha)
* Our own responsive layout driven plugins for common UX patterns such as [pagination](http://github.com/mathematic/pagination.js), [carousel](http://github.com/mathematic/carousel.js) and [resizing events](http://github.com/mathematic/windowResize.js).
